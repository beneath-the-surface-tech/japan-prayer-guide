        "Pray for Japanese Christians and missionaries to demonstrate joyful dependency on God.",
        "Pray for Japanese non-believers to see their limitations and need for God’s grace.",
        "Pray for grace and salvation to become as prevalent in Japan as <i>ganbatte</i> and <i>shōganai</i>."

        "There are two words you’re guaranteed to learn if you live in Japan:<br><i>Ganbatte</i>—Do your best, keep going.<br><i>Shōganai</i>—It can’t be helped, there’s nothing we can do.",
        "Together these words demonstrate the spirit of self-reliance that is common in Japanese thinking. Most problems can be solved by simply trying harder. And the things that can’t be solved this way are seen as things that just need to be tolerated.",
        "People work long hours to provide financial security for their families. Students study late into the night in order to pass entrance exams. They are relying on themselves to “do their best.”",
        "In many ways this strong work ethic and determined perseverance is admirable. But without reliance on the merciful God who calls us to rest in him, it can lead to bitterness, burnout, and breakdowns—of individuals, families, and society.",
        "Many Japanese apartments are filled with hard-earned comforts, but are empty of grace-filled relationships that give rest to the soul. And even missionaries need to keep a close watch on their hearts, that they don’t end up preaching at themselves “<i>ganbatte</i>!” and “<i>shōganai</i>!” rather than resting in the Lord and relying on his help."
