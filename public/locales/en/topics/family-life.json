        "“All my father cares about is work, so I’m doing whatever I want. He thinks I’m in California to study, but I’m here for the girls and the drugs.” ",
        "This young Japanese man didn’t know that the missionary he was sitting next to on the plane had counseled his father only weeks earlier. ",
        "The father had said, “I’ve been a slave to my work and neglected my family. Now my son won’t talk to me unless he wants money. How can I get him back?” ",
        "The missionary had explained the parable of the prodigal son to the father. On the plane he shared it with the son. Today father and son are reconciled and attend church together.",
        "The daily average time Japanese fathers spend with their children is less than in many other countries. They don’t see much of their wives either. Disconnectedness, loneliness, and confusion within families is widespread. Young people are avoiding marriage in increasing numbers. The government views low birth rates as a national crisis. ",
        "This situation has led some to seek the true meaning of marriage, help with parenting, or support for struggling children. Addressing family issues has provided opportunities to introduce biblical truths."
