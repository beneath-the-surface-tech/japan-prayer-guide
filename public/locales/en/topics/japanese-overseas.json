        "Rina had been a seeker at a church in Tokyo before she went to study in London. The pastor was later delighted to hear that she had come to faith while overseas.",
        "In 2021 more than 1.3 million Japanese were living abroad. It is estimated that every year nearly 1,000 Japanese people become Christians overseas.<sup>1</sup>",
        "This is a high percentage compared to those living in Japan, but as one church plant in Tokyo experienced, it can work the other way too. Some members became seekers overseas and then came to faith in Japan. God had been planting seeds in places as far-flung as Australia, Boston, and Singapore.",
        "Living abroad presents many challenges—language, a new culture, and distance from family and friends. Churches and Christian home-stay families around the world have an amazing opportunity to welcome Japanese people and share the gospel with them.",
        "Coming back to Japan can also be difficult. Seekers or new believers may feel discouraged if friends and family don’t understand the changes they are going through. They may struggle to find a church or other Christians nearby. Finding a caring community can help them replant and grow."
