        "“Can I have more ice cream?” The petite five-year-old girl had already eaten two bowlfuls. It was her first meal of the day. Her mother had sent her three daughters out of the house that morning when her new boyfriend came to visit. Later that day, the three girls had shown up at the church’s summer neighborhood event.",
        "Single parent families often struggle to make ends meet. Homeless people sleep in subway stations or under bridges. One in seven children live below Japan’s poverty line.<sup>1</sup> Despite Japan’s reputation as a wealthy nation, poor and marginalized people can be found throughout the country.",
        "It can seem easier to reach out to those whose struggles are visible. The majority of people in Japan—the middle class and the rich—can look like they have everything they need. But that is not always the case; they may have hidden emotional or other needs. It is only through authentic relationships that we discover what people are really searching for.",
        "The church the little girl had shown up at was within walking distance of two elementary schools. This is why they held children’s events. Other churches have different opportunities to make genuine connections with the communities around them."
