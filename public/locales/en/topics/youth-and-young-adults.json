        "“I feel like I’m just no good at being a Christian. I hardly read the Bible on my own, and even when I do, I don’t get it,” Hiroko confided to a staff member. It was 2 a.m. at a KGK<sup>*</sup> camp for university students. After a day of fellowship and fun, Hiroko poured out her heart. ",
        "“When I pray, I feel like I’m just talking to myself. I sometimes wonder if God even exists. I have a hard time wanting to go to church. I’m the only one my age there. Sometimes I just want to give up.”",
        "Unfortunately, Hiroko’s struggles are not uncommon in Japan. Christians are a tiny minority, and many churches are small and aging with few, if any, young people. ",
        "Young people in Japan, both Christian and non-Christian, may struggle with a number of concerns—among them, academic pressures, family, relationships, and their futures. It’s difficult to transition from university to the workplace, and concerns about finances have made young adults reluctant to get married or have children.",
        "It is vital for Christian young people to find fellowship and be equipped to share their faith with their peers. Parachurch organizations like KGK play a key role."
