## ADR-0001 - Decide on development environment / framework

### Context

The original scope of this project only involved one developer. As the team size increases we need to confirm and agree on what technologies we would all be comfortable working with.
In the prototype NextJS with typescript was used, and react-bootstrap was the framework of choice for styling, given the relative lack of experience in front-end development.

### Decision

- Use NextJS (no typescript)
- Use react-bootstrap
- Use typescript

### Status

âœ… CONFIRMED 2023/02/11

### Consequences

Once development officially commences, it would be hard to switch halfway to something different, so no matter the underlying technology, it should be agreed upon upfront.
